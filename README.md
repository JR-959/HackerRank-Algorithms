# Java-Algorithms-HackerRank-MySolutions-

The following repository contains my own solutions of the coding challenges
from HackerRank.com/Interviewstreet.com. 

## What is HackerRank?
HackerRank is a place where programmers from all over the world come together to solve problems in a wide range of Computer Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, as well as to practice different programming paradigms like functional programming.

The subtopics in the repository, such as **Arrays, Implementation, Strings, and etc.** are placed in separate folders. All
the uploaded code has passed all the test cases and produces the correct output
